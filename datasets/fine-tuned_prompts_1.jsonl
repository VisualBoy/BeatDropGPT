{"prompt": "Combine a radial blur with a zoom effect that follows the waveform.", "completion": "Implement a radial blur effect in the pixel shader. Use the 'wave_x' and 'wave_y' parameters to control the center point of the blur, making it follow the waveform's position. Simultaneously, adjust the 'zoom' parameter to create a zooming effect centered on the waveform.", "metadata": {"difficulty": "advanced", "effect_type": "parameter combination", "dependencies": ["pixel shader", "zoom parameter", "waveform parameters"]}}
{"prompt": "Create a pulsating border that changes color with the beat.", "completion": "Use the 'bass' or 'beat' variable to modulate the 'ob_size' parameter, creating a pulsating border thickness. Simultaneously, use the same audio variable to cycle through a sequence of colors for the 'ob_r', 'ob_g', and 'ob_b' parameters, making the border color change with the beat.", "metadata": {"difficulty": "medium", "effect_type": "parameter combination", "dependencies": ["border parameters", "audio analysis"]}}
{"prompt": "Make the motion vectors rotate and change color based on the treble frequencies.", "completion": "Use the 'treb' variable to control the rotation angle of the motion vectors using the 'mv_ang' parameter. Simultaneously, map the 'treb' variable to the 'mv_r', 'mv_g', and 'mv_b' parameters to dynamically change the motion vectors' color based on the treble frequencies.", "metadata": {"difficulty": "medium", "effect_type": "parameter combination", "dependencies": ["motion vector parameters", "audio analysis"]}}
{"prompt": "Invert the colors of the visualization except for the custom shapes.", "completion": "Set the 'invert' parameter to 1 to invert the overall colors. Modify the pixel shader code to selectively exclude the custom shapes from the inversion effect by checking their coordinates and applying the inverse color transformation only to pixels outside the custom shapes' boundaries.", "metadata": {"difficulty": "advanced", "effect_type": "parameter combination", "dependencies": ["pixel shader", "custom shapes"]}}
{"prompt": "Create a visualization that looks like a lava lamp, with slowly moving blobs of color.", "completion": "Define custom shapes that resemble blobs of liquid. Implement slow, fluid-like movement using the per-frame equations. Use a warm color palette with gradients and transparency effects to simulate the appearance of a lava lamp. You can also use the 'warp' parameter to create a subtle distortion effect.", "metadata": {"difficulty": "medium", "effect_type": "parameter combination", "dependencies": ["custom shapes", "per-frame equations", "color parameters"]}}
